So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in
Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and
all would change to dull reality--the grass would be only rustling
in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds--the
rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells, and the
Queen's shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd boy--and the
sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and all the other
queer noises, would change (she knew) to the confused clamour of
the busy farm-yard--while the lowing of the cattle in the distance
would take the place of the Mock Turtle's heavy sobs.
