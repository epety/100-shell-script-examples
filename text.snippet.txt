Perhaps one of the most valuable uses of shell scripts is to fix
your particular flavor of Unix and make it more like other flavors,
to bring your commands into conformance or to increase consistency
across different systems. The outsider view of Unix suggests a
nice, uniform command-line experience, helped along by the existence
and compliance with the POSIX standards for Unix, but anyone who's
ever touched more than one computer knows how much they can vary
within these broad parameters.
